# 🔥 Firebase Integration Complete!

## ✅ What Was Implemented

### 1. **Firestore Schema** (`src/types/firestore.ts`)
Production-ready TypeScript interfaces for:
- **UserAccount**: User profiles and settings
- **Organization**: Workspaces/projects with member management
- **OrgMember**: Role-based membership (owner, admin, member)
- **TrackedAccount**: Social media accounts being tracked
- **VideoDoc**: Videos with metrics, deltas, and snapshots
- **VideoSnapshot**: Historical data points for time-series analysis
- **TrackedLink**: Shortened links with click tracking
- **LinkClick**: Individual click events with device/location data

### 2. **Security Rules** (`firestore.rules`)
Role-based access control:
- ✅ Users can only access their own account data
- ✅ Organization members can only access their org's data
- ✅ Role hierarchy: Owner > Admin > Member
- ✅ Immutable snapshots (can't be edited after creation)
- ✅ Public link redirects (for `/l/{shortCode}`)

### 3. **Firestore Indexes** (`firestore.indexes.json`)
Optimized composite indexes for:
- Videos by org + lastRefreshed
- Videos by org + uploadDate
- Videos by org + trackedAccountId
- TrackedAccounts by org + platform
- Links by org + totalClicks
- And more...

### 4. **Organization Service** (`src/services/OrganizationService.ts`)
Manages users and organizations:
- `createUserAccount()` - Create user on first sign-in
- `createOrganization()` - Create new workspace
- `getUserOrganizations()` - Get user's orgs
- `getOrCreateDefaultOrg()` - Auto-create default org
- `addMember()` / `removeMember()` - Member management
- `hasOrgAccess()` / `getUserRole()` - Permission checks

### 5. **Firestore Data Service** (`src/services/FirestoreDataService.ts`)
CRUD operations for all data:
- **Tracked Accounts**: `addTrackedAccount()`, `getTrackedAccounts()`, `updateTrackedAccount()`, `deleteTrackedAccount()`
- **Videos**: `addVideo()`, `getVideos()`, `addVideoSnapshot()`, `getVideoSnapshots()`
- **Links**: `createLink()`, `getLinks()`, `recordLinkClick()`, `resolveShortCode()`

### 6. **Data Migration Service** (`src/services/DataMigrationService.ts`)
Automatic migration from localStorage to Firestore:
- Migrates all videos with metrics
- Migrates all tracked accounts
- Migrates all tracked links
- Runs once per user on first sign-in
- Preserves all historical data

### 7. **Updated Auth Context** (`src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`)
Enhanced authentication:
- Creates user account in Firestore on sign-in
- Auto-creates default organization for new users
- Exposes `currentOrgId` for multi-tenancy
- Provides `switchOrganization()` for workspace switching

### 8. **Documentation** (`FIREBASE_SETUP.md`)
Complete setup guide including:
- Data structure overview
- Security rules explanation
- Deployment instructions
- Usage examples
- Testing with emulators
- Monitoring tips

## 🏗️ Architecture

```
Client App (React)
    ↓
AuthContext (currentOrgId, user)
    ↓
┌─────────────────┬──────────────────┬─────────────────┐
│ OrganizationSvc │ FirestoreDataSvc │ DataMigrationSvc│
└────────┬────────┴────────┬─────────┴────────┬────────┘
         └─────────────────┴──────────────────┘
                           ↓
                    Firebase Firestore
                           ↓
                  Security Rules (enforced)
```

## 🔐 Multi-Tenancy

ViewTrack is now **fully multi-tenant**:

1. Each user can create/join multiple organizations
2. All data is scoped to an organization (`orgId`)
3. Security rules prevent cross-org access
4. Users can switch between organizations
5. Each org has independent member management

## 📊 Data Flow Example

```typescript
// 1. User signs in
const { user, currentOrgId } = useAuth();

// 2. Add a tracked account
const accountId = await FirestoreDataService.addTrackedAccount(
  currentOrgId,
  user.uid,
  { platform: 'tiktok', username: 'creator', accountType: 'my', isActive: true }
);

// 3. Add a video
const videoId = await FirestoreDataService.addVideo(
  currentOrgId,
  user.uid,
  {
    platform: 'tiktok',
    url: 'https://tiktok.com/@creator/video/123',
    trackedAccountId: accountId,
    views: 1000,
    likes: 50,
    isSingular: false,
    status: 'active'
  }
);

// 4. Refresh video metrics
await FirestoreDataService.addVideoSnapshot(
  currentOrgId,
  videoId,
  user.uid,
  { views: 5000, likes: 250, comments: 50 }
);
```

## 🚀 Next Steps

### To Deploy:

1. **Deploy Firestore Rules**:
   ```bash
   firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
   ```

2. **Deploy Indexes**:
   ```bash
   firebase deploy --only firestore:indexes
   ```

3. **Enable Authentication**:
   - Go to Firebase Console
   - Enable Google & Email/Password sign-in

### To Integrate with App:

The app is already integrated! On next sign-in:
- User account is created in Firestore
- Default organization is created
- localStorage data is migrated
- All new data goes to Firestore

### To Test Locally:

```bash
# Start Firebase emulators
firebase emulators:start

# Update src/services/firebase.ts to use emulators
# (see FIREBASE_SETUP.md for details)
```

## 📈 Benefits

✅ **Scalable**: Firestore handles millions of documents
✅ **Real-time**: Automatic sync across devices
✅ **Secure**: Role-based access control enforced at DB level
✅ **Multi-tenant**: Support for teams and workspaces
✅ **Historical Data**: Video snapshots for time-series analysis
✅ **Backup**: Firebase handles automatic backups
✅ **Cost-effective**: Pay only for what you use

## 🎯 Current Status

- ✅ Schema defined
- ✅ Security rules written
- ✅ Indexes configured
- ✅ Services implemented
- ✅ Auth integrated
- ✅ Migration ready
- ⏳ Needs deployment to Firebase
- ⏳ Needs UI integration for org switching

## 📝 Notes

- The existing localStorage data will be automatically migrated on first sign-in
- You can keep localStorage as a fallback/cache if needed
- All services are production-ready and follow best practices
- Security rules enforce all access control (never trust the client)
- Firestore costs scale with usage (monitor in Firebase Console)

## 🎉 Summary

You now have a **production-ready, multi-tenant, secure Firebase backend** for ViewTrack! 

The implementation follows all the requirements from your prompt while adapting to your existing codebase structure. All data is properly scoped, secured, and ready for team collaboration.
