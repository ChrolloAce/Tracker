## 📊 **Data Stored Locally**

### **Video Submissions Data:**
```javascript
{
  id: "DHo-T-dp2QT",
  instagramUrl: "https://www.instagram.com/reel/DHo-T-dp2QT/",
  thumbnail: "data:image/jpeg;base64,..." or "https://...",
  title: "🥳 Surprise! Join me for a bonus mini-episode...",
  uploader: "thestorieswecarry.pod",
  uploaderHandle: "thestorieswecarry.pod",
  status: "pending",
  views: 36,
  likes: 33,
  comments: 2,
  dateSubmitted: "2025-01-20T18:30:00.000Z"
}
```

### **Thumbnail Cache:**
- Key: `thumbnail_DHo-T-dp2QT`

## 📱 **Browser Storage Info**

You can check your stored data in:

2. Look for keys:
   - `instagram_submissions` (main data)
   - `thumbnail_[videoId]` (cached images)

## 🧪 **Test Local Storage**

1. **Add some videos** to your dashboard
2. **Close your browser completely**
3. **Reopen and go to** `http://localhost:5173`
4. **Watch console logs** - your data will be automatically loaded!

### **Try These Actions:**
- Add videos → Data saved automatically
- Refresh page → Data persists
- Close/reopen browser → Data still there

- Delete submissions → Removed from storage

## 🚀 **Production Ready**

The local storage system includes:
