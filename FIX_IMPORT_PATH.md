# FIX IMPORT PATH - VERCEL .JS EXTENSION REQUIREMENT

## 🔍 Problem Identified

After deploying the previous fix, the serverless function was still returning a 500 error with the message:
```
Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 500 ()
❌ Failed to parse JSON response: A server error has occurred
FUNCTION_INVOCATION_FAILED
```

This indicated the function was crashing before it could return a JSON response.

### Root Cause

The import statement for `runApifyActor` was missing the `.js` file extension:
```typescript
import { runApifyActor } from './apify-client';  // ❌ Missing .js extension
```

In Vercel's serverless environment, explicit file extensions are required for local module imports. Other API files like `sync-single-account.ts` were already using the correct pattern:
```typescript
import { runApifyActor } from './apify-client.js';  // ✅ Correct
```

## ✅ What Was Fixed

**Changed from:**
```typescript
import { runApifyActor } from './apify-client';
```

**Changed to:**
```typescript
import { runApifyActor } from './apify-client.js';
```

## 🔑 Why This Matters

Vercel's serverless functions run in a specific Node.js environment where:
1. Local imports (starting with `./` or `../`) must include the `.js` extension
2. Package imports (like `@vercel/node`) do NOT need extensions
3. This is different from TypeScript's local development where extensions are optional

## 🚀 Deployment

**Commit:** `Fix: Add .js extension to apify-client import for Vercel compatibility`

The fix has been pushed to git and Vercel will automatically deploy it.

## 📋 Files Modified

- ✅ `api/cron-refresh-videos.ts` - Added `.js` extension to import path

## 📊 Expected Results

After this deployment:
- ✅ The `/api/cron-refresh-videos` endpoint will load without crashing
- ✅ Manual video refresh will work for all platforms (Twitter, TikTok, Instagram)
- ✅ No more 500 errors or "Failed to parse JSON response" errors
- ✅ Proper JSON responses for both success and error cases

## 🔧 Lesson Learned

When creating new serverless functions on Vercel:
- Always check existing API files for import patterns
- Use `.js` extensions for local module imports
- Test imports match the working examples in the codebase
- Vercel's build environment is stricter than local TypeScript compilation
