# SCOPED REFRESH FIX SUMMARY

## 🔍 Problem Identified

When manually triggering the video refresh from the dashboard, the cron job was processing **all 5 organizations** (18 accounts total) instead of just the current active organization and project the user was viewing. This caused:

- Unnecessary processing of accounts from other organizations
- Longer refresh times
- Confusion about which accounts were being refreshed
- Potential rate limiting issues from processing too many accounts at once

## ✅ What Was Fixed

### 1. **Updated `api/cron-refresh-videos.ts`**

Added support for scoped refreshes:

- **Organization Scoping**: Added `organizationId` parameter to limit refresh to a specific organization
- **Project Scoping**: Added `projectId` parameter to limit refresh to a specific project
- **Backward Compatible**: When no scope is provided (scheduled cron jobs), it processes all organizations as before
- **Better Logging**: Enhanced logs to show which org/project is being processed

**Key Changes**:
```typescript
// Get scope from request body (for manual triggers)
const scopedOrgId = req.body?.organizationId;
const scopedProjectId = req.body?.projectId;

// Only process specified organization if provided
if (scopedOrgId) {
  const orgDoc = await db.collection('organizations').doc(scopedOrgId).get();
  orgsSnapshot = { docs: [orgDoc], size: 1 };
} else {
  // Scheduled cron: process all organizations
  orgsSnapshot = await db.collection('organizations').get();
}

// Only process specified project if provided
if (scopedProjectId && scopedOrgId === orgId) {
  const projectDoc = await db
    .collection('organizations')
    .doc(orgId)
    .collection('projects')
    .doc(scopedProjectId)
    .get();
  projectsSnapshot = { docs: [projectDoc], size: 1 };
}
```

### 2. **Updated `src/pages/DashboardPage.tsx`**

Modified the manual refresh function to pass current organization and project IDs:

```typescript
const response = await fetch('/api/cron-refresh-videos', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    manual: true,
    organizationId: currentOrgId,     // Only refresh current org
    projectId: currentProjectId       // Only refresh current project
  })
});
```

## 🎯 Expected Behavior After Fix

### Manual Triggers (from Dashboard)
- ✅ Only processes accounts in the **current organization**
- ✅ Only processes accounts in the **current project**
- ✅ Faster refresh times (fewer accounts to process)
- ✅ Clear logging showing which org/project is being refreshed

### Scheduled Cron Jobs (Automated)
- ✅ Still processes **all organizations** and **all projects**
- ✅ Continues to work as before for automated background sync
- ✅ No changes to existing scheduled behavior

## 📊 Example Output

**Before (Manual Trigger)**:
```
🚀 Starting automated video refresh (Manual Trigger)...
📊 Found 5 organizations
📁 Processing organization: 1aErC6SiYjqPxzLiwoEb
📁 Processing organization: SYC7PLIECOuxEJtacwCe
📁 Processing organization: jQFydFfLvAbSv3dQ3aH4
📁 Processing organization: p8B1Qw0wKAF1Q0LbXb6l
📁 Processing organization: pjrSi5AlXWyucfBC0KOG
📊 Accounts processed: 18
```

**After (Manual Trigger)**:
```
🚀 Starting automated video refresh (Manual Trigger) (Org: 1aErC6SiYjqPxzLiwoEb, Project: abc123)...
📊 Found 1 organization(s) to process
📁 Processing organization: 1aErC6SiYjqPxzLiwoEb
  📂 Found 1 project(s) to process
  📦 Processing project: Default Project
    👥 Found 5 active accounts
📊 Accounts processed: 5
```

## 🚀 Next Steps

To deploy these changes:

1. **Commit the changes**:
   ```bash
   git add api/cron-refresh-videos.ts src/pages/DashboardPage.tsx SCOPED_REFRESH_FIX.md
   git commit -m "Fix: Scope manual refresh to current organization and project"
   ```

2. **Push to repository**:
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

3. **Test the fix** (after Vercel deploys):
   - Navigate to your dashboard
   - Ensure you're viewing a specific organization and project
   - Click the manual refresh button
   - Verify in the logs that only your current org/project accounts are refreshed

## 📋 Files Modified

- ✅ `api/cron-refresh-videos.ts` - Added organization/project scoping
- ✅ `src/pages/DashboardPage.tsx` - Pass current org/project IDs to API
- ✅ `SCOPED_REFRESH_FIX.md` - Complete documentation of the fix

## 🔒 Security Note

The scoped refresh still maintains the same security:
- Manual triggers require `manual: true` flag
- Scheduled cron jobs require `CRON_SECRET` in Authorization header
- Organization/project IDs are validated before processing
