- [x] Modular design (interchangeable components)
- [x] File length < 200 lines per file
- [x] Function length < 40 lines
- [x] Descriptive naming throughout

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Visual Verification
**Expected Behavior:**
- Two animated rails emerge from left and right edges
- Rails curve inward toward hero text
- Pass through Instagram, TikTok, YouTube Shorts, and X icons
- Merge into single spine below platforms
- Continue smoothly to timeline anchor

**Test Steps:**
1. Navigate to landing page
2. Verify rails visible and animated
3. Check all 6 creator chips appear (3 per branch)
4. Confirm smooth gradient colors
5. Observe subtle shimmer animation

### 2. Responsive Behavior
**Test Steps:**
1. **Window Resize**
   - Drag browser window to different sizes
   - Expected: Rails stay perfectly aligned with icons
   - No drift or misalignment

2. **Mobile Viewport**
   - Resize to 375px width
   - Expected: Rails adjust to narrower spacing
   - All elements remain connected

3. **Scroll Testing**
   - Scroll page up and down
   - Expected: Rails maintain position relative to container
   - No jumping or repositioning

### 3. Reduced Motion Support
**Test Steps:**
1. Enable reduced motion:
   - **macOS**: System Preferences → Accessibility → Display → Reduce motion
   - **Windows**: Settings → Ease of Access → Display → Show animations
   - **Linux**: Depends on DE (usually in accessibility settings)

2. Reload page

3. **Expected Behavior:**
   - Static rails remain visible (no animation)
   - Shimmer effect disabled
   - Gradient and styling intact
   - Creator chips still visible

4. **Verification:**
   ```css
   /* Should see this in computed styles */
   animation: none;
   ```

### 4. Performance Testing
**Metrics to Check:**
- [ ] Page load time < 3s
- [ ] Smooth scrolling (60fps)
- [ ] No layout shift during render
- [ ] Memory usage stable during resize

**Chrome DevTools Steps:**
1. Open Performance tab
2. Record 10 seconds of:
   - Window resizing
   - Scrolling
   - Idle state
3. Verify:
   - No long tasks (> 50ms)
   - Steady 60fps during animations
   - No memory leaks

### 5. Anchor Validation
**Test Steps:**
1. **Remove an anchor** (temporary test):
   ```tsx
   {/* <div data-flow="platform-1" ... /> */}
   ```

2. **Expected Behavior:**
   - Red error message appears: "Missing anchors: platform-1"
   - No JavaScript errors in console

3. **Restore anchor** and verify error disappears

### 6. Browser Compatibility
Test in multiple browsers:
- [ ] Chrome 90+
- [ ] Firefox 88+
- [ ] Safari 14+
- [ ] Edge 90+

**Check:**
- Rails render correctly
- Gradients display properly
- Animations work (when motion enabled)
- No console errors

### 7. Edge Cases
**Test Scenarios:**
1. **Very wide viewport (> 2560px)**
   - Rails should still emerge from edges
   - Smooth curves maintained

2. **Very narrow viewport (< 375px)**
   - Rails adjust to tight spacing
   - No overlap of elements

3. **High zoom levels (200%+)**
   - Rails remain aligned
   - Text and icons readable

4. **Dark mode** (if applicable)
   - Gradients visible
   - Contrast maintained

## Known Limitations

1. **SVG Path Limitations**: Very complex curves may show minor rendering artifacts on some browsers
2. **Creator Chip Images**: Currently showing gradient placeholders (future: real avatars)
3. **Mobile Performance**: Shimmer animation may be disabled on low-end devices

## Future Testing Needs

- [ ] Accessibility audit (screen reader compatibility)
- [ ] Lighthouse performance score
- [ ] Cross-browser automated tests
- [ ] Visual regression testing
- [ ] Load testing with slow network

## Debugging Tools

### Enable Debug Mode
Check browser console for:
```javascript
// Anchor validation messages
Missing anchors: [list]

// Geometry calculations
viewBox: { width: 1920, height: 2400 }
```

### Inspect SVG
1. Right-click rails → Inspect Element
2. Find `<svg>` with class `pointer-events-none`
3. Examine path `d` attributes for curve data

### Performance Monitoring
```javascript
// In browser console
const observer = new PerformanceObserver((list) => {
  console.log(list.getEntries());
});
observer.observe({ entryTypes: ['measure'] });
```
