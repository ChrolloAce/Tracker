# ðŸ”§ Instagram Scraping Fix - 429 Error Resolution

## Problem
Your Instagram scraper was getting **429 "Too Many Requests"** errors from Instagram because it was using Apify's default **datacenter proxies**, which Instagram aggressively blocks.

## Solution Applied âœ…
Updated all Instagram scraping calls to use **RESIDENTIAL proxies** with additional anti-blocking measures:

### Files Updated:
1. âœ… `api/sync-single-account.ts` - Backend account syncing
2. âœ… `src/services/InstagramApiService.ts` - Frontend video fetching
3. âœ… `src/services/AccountTrackingServiceFirebase.ts` - Account tracking
4. âœ… `src/services/AccountTrackingService.ts` - Account tracking (legacy)

### Changes Made:
```javascript
proxyConfiguration: {
  useApifyProxy: true,
  apifyProxyGroups: ['RESIDENTIAL'],  // ðŸ”‘ Use RESIDENTIAL proxies
  apifyProxyCountry: 'US'             // US proxies for better compatibility
},
// Additional anti-blocking measures
maxRequestRetries: 5,                 // Retry failed requests
requestHandlerTimeoutSecs: 300,       // 5 minute timeout
maxConcurrency: 1                     // Reduce concurrency to avoid rate limits
```

## Important Notes

### ðŸ’° Cost Implications
**Residential proxies are MORE EXPENSIVE than datacenter proxies** on Apify:
- **Datacenter proxies**: ~$0.30 per GB
- **Residential proxies**: ~$12.50 per GB (40x more expensive!)

However, residential proxies are **NECESSARY** for Instagram to avoid 429 errors.

### ðŸ“Š Monitoring Usage
1. Go to [Apify Console](https://console.apify.com/)
2. Navigate to **Settings â†’ Usage and Billing**
3. Monitor your **Proxy usage** (especially residential)
4. Set up billing alerts to avoid unexpected costs

### ðŸŽ¯ Best Practices
1. **Limit maxReels**: Set to reasonable numbers (10-100) to control costs
2. **Use sparingly**: Only sync when necessary, not continuously
3. **Monitor runs**: Check Apify runs dashboard for failed/stuck runs
4. **Set budgets**: Configure spending limits in Apify settings

### ðŸš¨ If You Still Get 429 Errors

If you still encounter 429 errors even with residential proxies, try:

1. **Reduce maxReels further** (10-30 instead of 100)
2. **Increase delays between requests**:
   ```javascript
   requestHandlerTimeoutSecs: 600,  // 10 minutes
   maxConcurrency: 1,               // Keep at 1
   ```
3. **Use different proxy countries**: Try 'GB', 'CA', 'AU' instead of 'US'
4. **Contact Apify support**: They may need to rotate your proxy pool

### ðŸ”‘ Alternative Solutions (If Cost is Too High)

1. **Instagram Basic Display API** (free, but requires user authentication)
2. **Instagram Graph API** (free, for business accounts only)
3. **Reduce scraping frequency** (sync less often)
4. **Use manual upload** for critical accounts

## Testing

To test if the fix works:

1. Deploy your changes to Vercel:
   ```bash
   git add -A
   git commit -m "fix: Use residential proxies for Instagram scraping to prevent 429 errors"
   git push
   ```

2. Try adding an Instagram account through your app

3. Monitor the Apify run in [Apify Console](https://console.apify.com/actors/runs)

4. Check logs for successful completion (should see "âœ… NEW scraper returned X items")

## Support

If issues persist, check:
- âœ… APIFY_TOKEN is correctly set in Vercel environment variables
- âœ… Your Apify account has sufficient credits
- âœ… Residential proxy access is enabled in your Apify plan
- âœ… Instagram usernames are correct and accounts are public
