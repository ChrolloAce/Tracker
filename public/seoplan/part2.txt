============================
SECTION B — INTERNAL LINKING PLAN
============================

We follow 3 rules:

Rule 1 — Pillar → ALL Support Pages

Each support page gets 3 anchor variants from the pillar.

Rule 2 — Support → Pillar

Each support page links back with 1 branded-intent anchor.

Rule 3 — Lateral Links (Support ↔ Support)

3–4 relevant cross-links per cluster that strengthen semantic authority.

Rule 4 — Silo Bridges Only When Logical

For example, analytics ⇄ campaign management is a valid entity pair (KPIs ↔ campaign ROI).
