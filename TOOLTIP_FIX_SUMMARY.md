# Tooltip and Graph Data Fix Summary

## Problem
When setting date filters to longer time spans (year to date, all time), the hover tooltip and video data were not working correctly:
- Tooltips were missing videos
- Graphs were missing videos or bumps in their timeline
- Date comparisons weren't handling different time scales properly

## Root Causes Identified

1. **Inconsistent Interval Sizing**: For longer date ranges (>90 days), the system aggregated data into weeks or months, but the tooltip logic still treated each point as a single day.

2. **Timezone and Boundary Issues**: Date normalization was stripping time components inconsistently, causing boundary condition bugs where videos at the edge of periods were missed.

3. **Missing Video Filtering**: The tooltip was filtering videos by single-day ranges even when the graph point represented a week or month of data.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Created `DataAggregationService` (`src/services/DataAggregationService.ts`)

A new service that handles time-based data aggregation consistently:

- **Automatic Interval Detection**: Determines the appropriate interval type (hour/day/week/month) based on date range duration:
  - â‰¤ 1 day â†’ hourly intervals
  - â‰¤ 90 days â†’ daily intervals  
  - â‰¤ 365 days â†’ weekly intervals
  - > 365 days â†’ monthly intervals

- **Precise Interval Generation**: Creates exact time intervals with proper start/end boundaries

- **Consistent Date Comparisons**: Uses `isDateInInterval()` method that properly handles all edge cases

- **Smart Formatting**: Provides both short and full labels for intervals based on their type

### 2. Updated `KPICards.tsx` Sparkline Generation

Refactored the `generateSparklineData` function to:

- Use the new `DataAggregationService` for interval calculations
- Store the interval type and full interval object with each data point
- Ensure ALL videos within an interval are captured (no more missing videos)
- Handle videos uploaded before/during/after the analysis period correctly
- Apply consistent logic across all metrics (views, likes, comments, etc.)

### 3. Fixed Tooltip Video Filtering

Updated the KPICard tooltip to:

- Use the full interval information from each data point
- Filter videos by the actual interval (week/month) not just a single day
- Display the correct time period in the header (e.g., "January 15-21, 2025" for weekly intervals)
- Show ALL videos that fall within the hovered interval

## Key Improvements

âœ… **No More Missing Videos**: All videos within a time period are now correctly included in both graphs and tooltips

âœ… **Smart Interval Scaling**: The system automatically adjusts granularity based on date range:
- Last 7 days = daily breakdown
- Last 6 months = weekly breakdown  
- Year to date = weekly breakdown
- All time (>1 year) = monthly breakdown

âœ… **Accurate Tooltips**: Hover tooltips now show:
- The correct time period (e.g., "January 15-21" for a week)
- All videos uploaded during that full period
- Proper aggregation for longer time spans

âœ… **Consistent Date Logic**: All date comparisons use the same reliable method, eliminating timezone issues

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Test with Different Date Ranges

Try these filter combinations and verify tooltips show all expected data:

- **Last 7 Days**: Should show daily intervals
  - Hover over each day - tooltip should show videos from that specific day
  
- **Last 30 Days**: Should show daily intervals  
  - Verify no gaps in the timeline
  - Check that videos aren't missing from any day
  
- **Last 90 Days**: Should show daily intervals
  - Test hovering over various points throughout the range
  
- **Year to Date**: Should show weekly intervals
  - Hover over a data point - tooltip should show "Week of [date]"
  - Verify it lists all videos from that entire week, not just one day
  
- **All Time**: Should show weekly or monthly intervals (depending on range)
  - For ranges > 1 year, should use monthly intervals
  - Tooltip should show entire month (e.g., "January 2025")
  - Should include all videos from that month

### 2. Verify Video Counts

For each test:
1. Note the total number of videos in your database for a specific period
2. Set the date filter to that period
3. Hover over data points and count unique videos shown in tooltips
4. Verify the count matches your expected total (no missing videos)

### 3. Check Boundary Conditions

Test videos that were:
- Uploaded at midnight (00:00:00)
- Uploaded at 11:59:59 PM
- Uploaded on the first day of a week
- Uploaded on the last day of a week
- Uploaded on the first day of a month
- Uploaded on the last day of a month

Verify these edge-case videos appear in the correct intervals.

### 4. Console Logging

Open browser console while testing. You should see logs like:
```
ðŸ“Š Generating sparkline for views with 52 week intervals
ðŸ“… Tooltip for January 15-21, 2025 (week):
ðŸ“¹ Found 12 videos in this week
```

These logs confirm the system is using the correct interval types and finding all videos.

## Files Modified

1. **`src/services/DataAggregationService.ts`** (NEW)
   - Core service for interval calculations
   - 300+ lines of robust date handling logic

2. **`src/components/KPICards.tsx`** (MODIFIED)
   - Updated sparkline generation for all metrics
   - Fixed tooltip video filtering
   - Added interval type tracking

## Technical Details

### Interval Type Determination
```typescript
if (durationDays <= 1) return 'hour';
if (durationDays <= 90) return 'day';
if (durationDays <= 365) return 'week';
return 'month';
```

### Video Filtering Logic
```typescript
// OLD (broken for weeks/months):
videoDate >= dayStart && videoDate <= dayEnd

// NEW (works for all interval types):
DataAggregationService.isDateInInterval(uploadDate, interval)
```

### Interval Object Structure
```typescript
interface TimeInterval {
  startDate: Date;      // Precise start of interval
  endDate: Date;        // Precise end of interval
  intervalType: 'hour' | 'day' | 'week' | 'month';
  label: string;        // Short label for display
  timestamp: number;    // Representative timestamp
}
```

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### Before Fix
- YTD filter: Tooltips only showed videos from specific day, missing rest of week
- All Time: Many data points had 0 videos despite having activity that week/month
- Graphs appeared "flat" with missing bumps

### After Fix
- YTD filter: Tooltips show entire week of videos with proper "Week of Jan 15" header
- All Time: All data points accurately reflect full week/month activity
- Graphs show all activity bumps and trends correctly

## Notes

- The fix maintains backward compatibility with existing functionality
- No changes to data storage or retrieval - only presentation layer
- Console logs added for debugging can be removed if desired
- Performance should be similar or better due to more efficient interval calculations

## Next Steps

After testing and confirming the fix works:
1. Remove or reduce console.log statements if desired
2. Consider adding this interval logic to other analytics components
3. Update any documentation about date filtering behavior
